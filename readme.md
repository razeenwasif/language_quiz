# Language Quiz App

An interactive web application that helps users practice writing characters from different writing systems using machine learning. The app supports English letters, Greek letters, and Japanese Hiragana characters.

## Features

- **Multiple Language Support**:

  - English alphabet (A-Z)
  - Greek alphabet (α-ω)
  - Japanese Hiragana (あ-ん)
- **Interactive Drawing Interface**:

  - Draw characters using your mouse or touch screen
  - Real-time character recognition using machine learning models
  - Immediate feedback on your drawing accuracy
- **Machine Learning Integration**:

  - Uses TensorFlow/Keras models for character recognition
  - Separate models for each writing system
  - Real-time prediction and feedback

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**:

  - Python 3.12
  - Flask (Web Framework)
  - TensorFlow/Keras (Machine Learning)
  - NumPy (Numerical Computing)
- **Frontend**:

  - HTML5
  - CSS3
  - JavaScript
  - Canvas API for drawing
